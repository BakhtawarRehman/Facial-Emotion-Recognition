# Facial-Emotion-Recognition

This Repository is all about facial gesture recognition.


**JAFFE.ipynb** This notebook contains work on emotion recognition using facial images on JAFFE (Japanese Models Facial expression). There are total 213 images in this dataset i.e: happy, sad, angry, afraid, surprise,disgust, and neutral. For training convnet is used. ~85% accuracy on validation set is acheived. It is very difficult to avoid overfitting due to small dataset and any image augmentation resulted in worseining overall results. 


**FER2013.ipynb** notebook contains work on emotion recognition using facial images. The dataset used for this task is FER2013 dataset released by microsoft: (https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data). According to this dataset and many more there  are seven universal facial emotions (some modern studies might not agree) i.e: happy, sad, angry, afraid, surprise,disgust, and neutral. 

It is implemented with tensorlfow.


## TODO
- Implementation with Spatial ransformer.

P.S: Notebooks with other datasets will be uploaded soon.
